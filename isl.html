                Islamabad is the capital city of Pakistan.
                It is known for its greenery, modern infrastructure, and peaceful environment.Islamabad (/ɪzˈlɑːməbæd/ ⓘ;[6] Urdu: اسلام‌آباد, romanised: Islāmābād, lit. 'City of Islam', [ɪsˈlɑːmɑːbɑːd] ⓘ) is the capital city of Pakistan.[7][8] It is the country's tenth-most populous city with a population of over 1.1 million, and is federally administered by the Pakistani government as part of the Islamabad Capital Territory. Built as a planned city in the 1960s and established in 1967, it replaced Karachi as Pakistan's national capital. Islamabad is located north of the city of Rawalpindi, with which it forms a metropolitan area of over 5.7 million inhabitants.

The Greek architect Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis developed Islamabad's master plan, in which he divided it into eight zones; the city comprises administrative, diplomatic enclave, residential areas, educational and industrial sectors, commercial areas, as well as rural and green areas administered by the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation with support from the Capital Development Authority. Islamabad is known for its parks and forests, including the Margalla Hills National Park and the Shakarparian. It is home to several landmarks, including the country's flagship Faisal Mosque. Other prominent landmarks include the Pakistan Monument and Democracy Square.[9][10][11]

Rated as Gamma+ by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network,[12] Islamabad has one of the highest costs of living in Pakistan. The city's populace is dominated by both middle- and upper-middle-class citizens.[13][14] Islamabad is home to more than twenty universities, including Bahria University, Quaid-e-Azam University, PIEAS, COMSATS University, and NUST. It is also rated as one of the safest cities in Pakistan and has an expansive RFID-enabled surveillance system with almost 2,000 active CCTV cameras.[15][16]

Toponymy
The name Islamabad means City of Islam. It is derived from two words; Islam and abad. The Arabic word Islam means "submission [to God]" as it refers to the religion of Islam, Pakistan's state religion, and the Persian suffix -abad means cultivated place, indicating an inhabited place or city.[17] During the course of early modern period, the name was used in the Mughal era, by the emperor Aurangzeb who named many towns in the Indian subcontinent after it.[18][c] According to a history book by Muhammad Ismail Zabeeh, teacher and poet Qazi Abdur Rehman Amritsari proposed the name of the city.[20][21]

Occasionally in writing, Islamabad is colloquially abbreviated ISB. Such usage originated in SMS language, in part due to the IATA location identifier for the Islamabad International Airport.
